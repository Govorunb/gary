# Security Policy

The old Python app is **not supported**. Please use the new [Tauri app](https://github.com/Govorunb/gary/releases) if you are able - or open an issue if there's critical functionality not present in the new app you can't live without.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please note this is a *local-only app*. Thus, the threat model is low-level browser/Tauri bugs (please report those upstream) or someone that already has local access (and can read all the API keys you put in `.bashrc`).

Otherwise, please report security issues privately through GitHub's [Security tab](https://github.com/Govorunb/gary/security/advisories/new).
